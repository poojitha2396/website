<li>What Is Art?</li>
<ul>There are about as many definitions of art as there are people alive. As a widely accepted definition, art is produced when oneâ€™s imagination or creativity is used to create something that can be directly experienced through our senses. Although visual art, witnessed through our sense of sight, is the most common form of art, art itself can appeal to other senses, including our auditory and tactile senses.</ul>

<p3>Most art forms discussed in this article date back thousands of years. From prehistoric cave paintings and figurines found in ancient caves, to the exquisite architecture and sculpture of ancient Greece and Rome, art forms have played a monumental part in personal and public life.</p3>
